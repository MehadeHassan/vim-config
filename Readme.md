VIM Bundle and Configuration
===========================

This is just my personal collection and configuration of VIM plugins. It currenctly has a focus on
Google Go and JavaScript Plugins. There are a lot of different collections out there if you are
looking for an all-in-one solution.

Installation
------------

To use this u need to symlink your `~/.vimrc` to the `.vimrc` in this repository.
After that, you need to install vundle manually. Then you can use the Vundle PluginInstall 
command. For Vundle Usage please read their documentation here:
https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```
